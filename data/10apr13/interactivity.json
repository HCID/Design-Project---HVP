                "abstract": "We explore how to track people and furniture based on a high-resolution pressure-sensitive floor. Gravity pushes people and objects against the floor, causing them to leave imprints of pressure distributions across the surface. While the sensor is limited to sensing direct contact with the surface, we can sometimes conclude what takes place above the surface, such as users’ poses or collisions with virtual objects. We demonstrate how to extend the range of this approach by sensing through passive furniture that propagates pressure to the floor. To explore our approach, we have created an 8 m2 back-projected floor prototype, termed GravitySpace, a set of passive touch-sensitive furniture, as well as algorithms for identifying users, furniture, and poses. Pressure-based sensing on the floor offers four potential benefits over camera-based solutions: (1) it provides consistent coverage of rooms wall-to-wall, (2) is less susceptible to occlusion between users, (3) allows for the use of simpler recognition algorithms, and (4) intrudes less on users’ privacy.",

                "abstract": "We present GaussBits, which is a system of the passive magnetic tangible designs that enables 3D tangible interactions in the near-surface space of portable displays. When a thin magnetic sensor grid is attached to the back of the display, the 3D position and partial 3D orientation of the GaussBits can be resolved by the proposed bi-polar magnetic field tracking technique. This portable platform can therefore enrich tangible interactions by extending the design space to the near-surface space. Since non-ferrous materials, such as the user's hand, do not occlude the magnetic field, interaction designers can freely incorporate a magnetic unit into an appropriately shaped non-ferrous object to exploit the metaphors of the real-world tasks, and users can freely manipulate the GaussBits by hands or using other non-ferrous tools without causing interference. The presented example applications and the collected feedback from an explorative workshop revealed that this new approach is widely applicable.",

In this work \\ we present SideWays, a novel person-independent eye gaze \\ interface that supports spontaneous interaction with displays: \\ users can just walk up to a display and immediately interact \\ using their eyes, without any prior user calibration or training. \\ Requiring only a single off-the-shelf camera and lightweight \\ image processing, SideWays robustly detects whether users \\ attend to the centre of the display or cast glances to the left \\ or right. The system supports an interaction model in which \\ attention to the central display is the default state, while “sidelong \\ glances” trigger input or actions. The robustness of the \\ system and usability of the interaction model are validated \\ in a study with 14 participants. Analysis of the participants’ \\ strategies in performing different tasks provides insights on \\ gaze control strategies for design of SideWays applications.",

Many games strongly focus on able-bodied persons and require players to move around freely. To address this problem, we introduce KINECTWheels, a toolkit that facilitates the integration of wheelchair-based game input. Our library can help game designers to integrate wheelchair input at the development stage, and it can be configured to trigger keystroke events to make off-the-shelf PC games wheelchair-accessible.",

We built two prototypes: (1) The longRangeOuija is a stationary prototype that offers a large motion range and full control; (2) The pocketOuija is self-contained mobile device based on an iPhone.

We have developed two kinds of device: “EaTheremin” is a fork-type device used for eating, and “TeaTheremin” is a cup-type device used for drinking. These devices emit sounds when a user is consuming a food item. In this paper, we discuss the EducaTableware concept, describe the implementation of EaTheremin and TeaTheremin, and show the usages.",

Most prior research assumed users to share the same overall display output; a key challenge was the appropriate partitioning of screen real estate, assembling the right information \"at the users’ finger-tips\" through simultaneous input. A different approach is followed in recent multi-view display environments: they offer personal output for each team member, yet risk to dissolve the team due to the lack of a common visual focus. Our approach combines both lines of thought, guided by the question: “What if the visible output and simultaneous input was partly shared and partly private?” We present Permulin as a concrete corresponding implementation, based on a set of novel interaction concepts that support fluid transitions between individual, group activities and coordination of group activities.",

LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting the resulting 3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser’s power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down — when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled. We present the three main design elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate how to use them to fabricate a range of physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami, a process in which user interaction and fabrication alternate step-by-step.",

Tangible human bodies, it is hoped, can provide a conceptual and empirical bridge suffi\u000ecient to convey intangible human experiences; a hope shared by technologies such as avatars and embodied robots. Surface tension explores this idea by testing the boundary between the embodied and disembodied expression of pain. The installation uses motion-capture data of people describing personal experiences of pain. Their original gestural movements are extracted and translated into mechanical gesticulations that stretch and trace forms onto the surface of a canvas; mapping the twists, turns, contractions and accelerations of \fngers and hands articulating an experience of pain. We manipulate the parameters of the original motions to ask in what ways can a disembodied translation of a human description of pain evoke recognition or empathy in the viewer?",

Repentir recognises the position and orientation of a specific painting within a photograph and precisely overlays images that were captured during that painting's creation. The viewer may then browse through the work's multiple states and closely examine its painted surface in one of two ways: sliding or rubbing. Our current prototype recognises realist painter Nathan Walsh's most recent work, “Transamerica”. Repentir enables the viewer to explore intermediary stages in the painting’s development and see what is usually lost within the materially additive painting process. The prototype offers an innovative approach to digital reproduction and provides users with unique insights into the painter's working method.",

We propose mobile force feedback devices based on actuating the user’s muscles using electrical stimulation. Since this allows us to eliminate motors, our approach results in devices that are substantially smaller and lighter than traditional motor based devices. We present a simple prototype that we mount to the back of a mobile phone. It actuates users’ forearm muscles via four electrodes, causing the muscles to contract involuntarily, so that users tilt the device sideways. As users resist this motion using their other arm, they perceive force feedback. We demonstrate the interaction at the example of an interactive videogame in which users try to steer an airplane through winds rendered using force feedback.",

We chart an iterative collaboration with ceramic designers and a restaurant to refine a recognition technology to work reliably on ceramics, produce a pattern book of designs, and prototype sets of tableware and a mobile app to enhance a dining experience. We document how the designers learned to work with and creatively exploit the technology, enriching their patterns with embellishments and backgrounds and developing strategies for embedding codes into complex designs. We discuss the potential and challenges of interacting with such patterns. We argue for a transition from designing ‘codes to patterns’ that reflects the skills of designers alongside the development of new technologies.",

Multiple force-feedbacks are applied to the seated user’s body to generate a 6DoF sensation of motion while experiencing passive navigation.

In this paper, we present PaperTonnetz, a tool that lets musicians explore and compose music with Tonnetz representations by making gestures on interactive paper. In addition to triggering musical notes with the pen as a button based-interface, the drawn gestures become interactive paths that can be used as chords or melodies to support composition.",

It displays the magnitude of frequency akin to traditional graphic equalizers or other sound visualizers, and it also allows the user to distort and create sounds by touch interaction. The user can create virtual balls or instrument icons on the screen and can cause these objects to collide with the equalizer by using a physics engine. When virtual balls collide with the equalizer bars, the magnitude of certain frequencies is amplified. When equalizer bars strikes an instruments icon, it create an instrumental sound effect. Until the invention of SOUND BOUND, the activities involved in listening to music have been essentially passive and static. SOUND BOUND actively engages people in the activity of listening to music and enhances their experience as well.",

                "abstract": "When working with zoomable information spaces, we can distinguish complex tasks into primary and secondary tasks (e.g., pan and zoom). In this context, a multimodal combination of gaze and foot input is highly promising for supporting manual interactions, for example, using mouse and keyboard. Motivated by this, we present several alternatives for multimodal gaze-supported foot interaction in a computer desktop setup for pan and zoom. While our eye gaze is ideal to indicate a user’s current point of interest and where to zoom in, foot interaction is well suited for parallel input controls, for example, to specify the zooming speed. Our investigation focuses on varied foot input devices differing in their degree of freedom (e.g., one- and two-directional foot pedals) that can be seamlessly combined with gaze input.",

Extending this, we are interested in digital play in these conditions, and in particular see an opportunity to explore underwater bodily games. We present an interactive shallow-water system that supports bodily play through water-movement interactions: Gravity Well. Through designing the system and combining aquabatic principles with exertion game design strategies, we identified a set of design tactics for underwater play based on the relationship between the afforded type, and level, of bodily exertion relative to pressure change and narcosis. With our work, we aim to inspire designers to utilize the unique characteristics of bodily interactions underwater and guide them in developing digital play in altered gravity domains.",

An interdisciplinary team developed this system and has deployed it as a cultural probe around the world to explore ways that technology can foster emotional connectedness. In this system, images that participants share on social media are projected onto a large interactive display. A multimodal interface displays the sentiment analysis of image captions and invites viewers to adjust this classification in order to express their emotional response to the images. Viewers can adjust the emotional classification and thereby change the colors and sound associated with a picture, and compose musical scores by touching a series of images. CHI participants will be able to share their own content and their emotional reaction to other images throughout the conference. If CHI attendees share feedback about presentations through this system, an affective map of the conference may emerge",

This problem is exacerbated by manufacturers producing phones with larger screens which are more difficult to hold and operate one-handedly.

It transforms input for form elements, media control and page access on the fly into a thumb-friendly interaction model. Initial user testing of our interface prototype confirms efficiency and learnability, and highlights its usefulness for navigating long pages and finding the desired information more quickly, even between different websites, when operating the device with one hand.",

However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one’s social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events. The results showed that sharing heart rate data does influence the relationship of the persons involved and that the degree of influence seems related to the tie strength prior to visualizing the data.",

We built a prototype interface realizing the DIRTI principles based on low-cost commodity hardware and kitchenware: A video camera tracks a granular or liquid interaction material placed in a glass dish.  The 3D relief estimated from the images, and the dynamic changes applied to it by the user(s), are used to control two applications: For 3D scene authoring, the relief is directly translated into a terrain, allowing fast and intuitive map editing. For expressive audio–graphic music performance, both the relief and real-time changes are interpreted as activation profiles to drive corpus-based concatenative sound synthesis, allowing one or more musicians to mold sonic landscapes and to plow through them in an inherently collaborative, expressive, and dynamic experience. \\ ",

The aim of SimpleTones is to make collaborative musical experiences more approachable and accessible for a wide range of users of different levels of musical expertise. This allows them to actively participate in the social aspects of collective musical improvisation, something usually confined to trained performers. Players can participate with ease and in real time by operating physical sound controllers in tandem. By using play as a catalyst and setting novices free from the requirement of previous musical experience, participants are able to focus on the collaborative aspects of performance, such as synchronizing movements, discovering the system’s functionality together and making collective decisions.",

Although some exertion games support social experiences, they rarely consider or support body contact. We believe overlooking body contact as part of social play experiences limits opportunities to design engaging exertion games. To explore this opportunity, we present Bubble Popper, an exertion game that considers and facilitates body contact. Bubble Popper, which uses very simple technology, also demonstrates that considering and facilitating body contact can be achieved without the need to sense body contact. Through reflecting on our design and analyzing observations of play, we are able to articulate what impact physical space layout in relation to digital game elements, and physical disparity between input and digital display can have on body contact. Our results aid game designers in creating engaging exertion games by guiding them when considering body contact, ultimately helping players benefit more from engaging exertion games.",

                "abstract": "Interactive technology can support exertion activities, with many examples focusing on improving athletic performance. We see an opportunity for technology to also support extreme sports such as skateboarding, which often focus primarily on the experience of doing tricks rather than on athletic performance. However, there is little knowledge on how to design for such experiences. In response, we designed 12 basic skateboarding prototypes inspired by skateboarding theory. Using an autoethnographical approach, we skated with each of these and reflected on our experiences in order to derive four design themes : location of feedback in relation to the skater’s body, timing of feedback in relation to peaks in emotions after attempts, aspects of the trick emphasized by feedback, and aesthetic fittingness of feedback. We hope our work will guide designers of interactive systems for skateboarding and extreme sports in general, and will therefore further our understanding of how to design for the active human body.",

We specially focus on the communications among wheelchair users and companions because the face-to-face communication is known to be effective to ameliorate elderly mental health.

                "abstract": "This extended abstract presents Kalpana II, a low cost learning installation with enhanced audio feedback that teaches users “Sun changes its trajectory in sky with change in location and time of the year”. It is based on the previously published research paper, “Kalpana: A Dome based Learning Installation for Indian Schools” that evaluates three different mediums (Conventional paper based, screen based and Dome based medium) that can be used to teach the same topic. \\   \\ With Kalpana, students can interact with simple known objects like globe and corresponding changes can be observed on Dome. These objects are made responsive to give visual and audio feedback. Kalpana empowered students to visualize the phenomenon that sun changes its trajectory in the sky with change in location or time of the year. Students interact with the interactive physical model and the corresponding response can be observed on dome supported with contextual audio feedback. \\ ",

However, examples from the traditional games domain suggest that social awkwardness can facilitate engaging experiences. Yet so far, there has been little research into social awkwardness and digital games. In acknowledgement of this, we present Musical Embrace, a digital game that promotes close physical contact between two strangers, through the use of a novel pillow-like controller, in order to navigate a virtual soundscape. Through our observations from demonstrating Musical Embrace at a number of events, we have procured a set of strategies intend on engaging players by “facilitating” social awkwardness, allowing players to “transform” while also letting players take “control” of social awkwardness. With our work we hope to inspire game designers to consider the potential of social awkwardness and guide them when using it for engaging playful experiences. \\  \\ ",

Throughput is calculated as mutual information in repeated motor sequences. It is affected by the complexity of movements and the precision with which an actor reproduces them. Computation requires decorrelating co-dependencies of movement features (e.g., wrist and elbow) and temporal alignment of sequences. HCI researchers can use the metric as an analysis tool when designing and studying user interfaces.",

This means that users will have to find ways to support the device that often require one hand to hold it, constraining their ability to use two hands on the touchscreen. Our ongoing work explores the possibility of using novel input modalities mounted on the tablet to enable simultaneous two-handed input while the user is holding the device. This paper presents a bimanual scrolling technique that splits the control of scrolling speed and scrolling direction across two hands using a combination of pressure, physical dial and touch input.

We introduce Pursuits, a novel and very different eye tracking method that instead is based on following the trajectory of eye movement and comparing this with trajectories of objects in the field of view. Because the eyes naturally follow the trajectory of moving objects of interest, our method is able to detect what the user is looking at, by matching eye movement and object movement. We illustrate Pursuits with three applications that demonstrate how the method facilitates natural interaction with moving targets.  \\ ",

The blocks can then be snapped together playing the recorded audio in a sequence, by reordering the blocks in different ways the audio sequence changes according to the order of the blocks. t-words does not need a computer, which makes it flexible for various contexts. The interface was presented during two workshops that took place in Kathmandu – Nepal with two schools. During the workshops children used the interface playfully exploring sounds, words and sentences while engaging in collaborative work.",

Papertab merges the benefits of working with electronic documents with the tangibility of paper documents. In Papertab, each document window is represented as a physical, functional, flexible e-paper screen called a displaywindow. Each displaywindow is an Android computer that can show documents at varying resolutions. The location of displaywindows is tracked on the desk using an electro-magnetic tracker. This allows for context-aware operations between displaywindows. Touch and bend sensors in each displaywindow allow users to navigate content.",

                "abstract": "Practitioner-led artistic research, combined with interactive technologies, opens up new and unexplored design spaces. Here we focus on the creation of a tool for opera-singers to dynamically disform, change and accompany their voices. In an opera composed by one of the authors, the title-role singer needed to be able to alter his voice to express hawking, coughing, snuffling and other disturbing vocal qualities associated with the lead role – Joseph Merrick, aka \"The Elephant Man\". In our designerly exploration, we were guided by artistic experiences from the opera tradition and affordances of the technology at hand. The resulting instrument, The Throat III, is a singer-operated artefact that embodies and extends particular notions of operatic singing techniques while at the same time creating accompaniment. It therefore becomes an emancipatory tool, putting a spotlight on some of the power hierarchies between singers, composers, conductors, and stage directors in the operatic world.",

Traditionally, the onus of planning is placed entirely on the organizers and involves only a few individuals. Cobi presents an alternative approach to conference scheduling that engages the entire community to take active roles in the planning process. The Cobi system consists of a collection of crowdsourcing applications that elicit preferences and constraints from the community, and software that enable organizers and other community members to take informed actions toward improving the schedule based on collected information. We are currently piloting Cobi as part of the CHI 2013 planning process.",

The interaction design made the control similar to a shaker where the motion energy drives the energy of the played music piece. The instrument has been designed for musicians as well as non-musicians and allows for multiple players. In the MubuFunkScatShare performance, one performer plays acoustical instruments into the system, subsequently rendering them by shaking a smartphone. He invites participation by volunteers from the audience, resulting in a fun musical piece that includes layers of funk guitar, scat singing, guitar solo, and beatboxing.",

                "abstract": "Command Line Interface (CLI) is the most popular and basic user interface to interact with computers. Despite its simplicity, it has some limitations in terms of user experience. For example, sometimes it is hard to understand and interpret the textual output of the command. In this paper we describe the limitations of command line interfaces and propose Gracoli: A graphical command line interface that takes advantage of both text-based interface and graphical user interface to provide better user experience and perform complex tasks. We demonstrate some of the useful applications and features of Gracoli. Sometime such a hybrid system provides and combines the strengths of CLI and GUI to perform specific tasks. We explore some useful applications of Gracoli to create a new kind of user experience. Command line interface makes accessibility faster and Graphical User-Interface makes output more interactive and understandable.",

It follows a soft toy design, using conductive textiles for pressure sensing and circuitry. The system is a highly sensitive deformable controller; it can be used flexibly in a range of scenarios for continuous or discrete control, allowing interaction to be designed at a range of complexity levels. The controller is wireless, and can be used to extend the interactive possibilities of mobile computing devices.  Multiple controllers may also be networked together in collaborative scenarios.",

We envision that a set of predefined shapes could be mapped onto particular applications and functions. In its current implementation, we present three shapes that MARSUI can be deformed into: circular band, flat surface and sharp bent. These shapes map respectively onto the following applications: wristwatch, mobile phone and media player. Since the malleable interface can also take other forms, feedback plays an important role in guiding the user towards the predefined shapes. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibilities that auditory feedback could offer in guiding the user towards reaching the intended shapes.",

It consists of a set of cubes that are seamlessly compatible with the cuboro cubes. In contrast to the passive cuboro cubes, cuboino modules are active parts of a digital system consisting of sensor cubes, actor cubes and supply cubes. By snapping them together, the player can build a modular system that functions according to he individual functionalities of the cuboino cubes. \\ Cuboino establishes a new pathway that is not embodied in the marble, but adapts to the medium of its transmission. Signals can be received by multiple modules, creating more than one signal at a time. This allows signals to intertwine and thus create more dynamic and complex game outcomes.",

However, it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player’s fingers on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands of hours learning? In the associated paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the continuous pitch control system. This Interactivity exhibit presents the extended keyboard.",

Today there is a trade-off present in the state of the art for music-related networking.  At one extreme, we have many systems still using MIDI, an old and insufficient standard for specifying keyboard-oriented commands embedded in short, coded 3-byte messages, limiting modulation controls to a 7-bit range.  At the other extreme we have Open Sound Control (OSC), a flexible packet format that supports named data and a wide number of binary numerical representations, but lacks built-in semantic standards. \\  \\ The present work proposes a semantic layer built on OSC over multicast UDP/IP used to carry metadata about signals, which can specify peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes along with instructions for associated translation of data representations.  The translation layer avoids the need for normalization or standardization of data representation while maintaining ease of use and providing a distributed, flexible approach to music networking.  The goal is to provide a system for fast and dynamic experimentation during the mapping phase of instrument design.",
